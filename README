This is a Kaggle project for CS 155 at Caltech on Sentiment Analysis / Text
Classification. 

    Each sample in this project corresponds to a speech, pre-processed into a
    bag-of-words representation. The goal of the project is to investigate 
    various machine learning models to predict opposition (=0) or support (=1)
    given some sample. The results of the project as well are summarized in a 
    report under docs/.

    The code has been recently been refactored and the directory tree has been 
    restructured by Dryden Bouamalay. 

    Original contributors to the project were: Jeffery An, Rohan Batra, and 
    Dryden Bouamalay.

    Project structure: 
        data/           Contains preprocessing scripts and data files to run the 
                        analysis. Under raw/, "training_data.txt" contains 4189 
                        speeches used train our models, while "testing_data.txt" 
                        contains 1355 test points used for making predictions. 
        docs/           Contains a PDF summarizing the results of the project.
        models/         Contains Python scripts which can be run on data files 
                        in data/ to generate .csv files to predictions/.
        predictions/    Contains .csv files that comprise model predictions. 

    To test out a model, run Python on the corresponding script in models/ with
    training and test data as arguments, i.e.: 

        python dtree_adaboost.py -t ../../data/raw/training_data.txt -v 
        ../../data/raw/testing_data.txt
    
    The predictions made by the model will be put in predictions/.
